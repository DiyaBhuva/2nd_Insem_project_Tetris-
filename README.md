-[Description](#Description)
**ðŸŽ® Classic Tetris Game**  
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game where the player manipulates falling **tetrominoes** (shapes made of four blocks) to create complete horizontal lines. Our Tetris game runs on a **grid of size 10x20**, where pieces spawn at the top and gradually fall downward. The player can rotate and move the pieces left or right using **keyboard inputs** (W/A/S/D or arrow keys). Pressing **down accelerates** the falling speed of the piece.  
ðŸ›  **Implementation Details:**  
ðŸ”¹ **Object-Oriented Approach**: Classes for **Tetrominoes, Game Board, and Game Controller**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Grid Representation**: A **2D array** stores the board, and tetrominoes are handled using **vector-based rotation matrices**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Collision Handling**: Ensures blocks **lock** in place and prevents movement outside boundaries.  
ðŸ”¹ **Scoring System**: **Points increase** based on the number of lines cleared simultaneously.  
ðŸ”¹ **Game Over & Score Display**: The final score appears in the **terminal** after the game ends.  

This project uses **loops, conditionals, and functions** to create an engaging **Tetris experience** with smooth controls and dynamic difficulty! ðŸš€
